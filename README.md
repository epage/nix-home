> nix-home: user configuration for Nix

# Implementation

- `machines/`: top-level files.
- `profiles/`: slices of configuration that can be pulled in.
- `hardware/`: Low-level hardware support (on top of the auto-generated `hardware-configuration. nix`)
- `users/`: Potential users for the various machines.
- `pkgs/`: TBD
